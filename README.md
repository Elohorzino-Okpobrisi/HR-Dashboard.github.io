## Introduction
In this project, I cleaned, analysed and visualised the dataset containing employee records in a company in the year 2022. Leveraging on excel, I cleaned and analysed the dataset and after it was satisfactory, I utilised used Power BI to create measures, which i used in efficent visualisation of the analysed data. This is the breakdown of the flow of the project.

These findings contribute to a better understanding of the workforce dynamics and can inform strategic decisions related to recruitment, retention, career development, and fostering a positive work environment. 

This project aided the enhancement of my analytical skills, specifically my PowerBI skills, I expanded my knowledge and usage of measures, buttons, etc. It furthered my ability to analyze complex datasets and discover meanungful insights for decison making.
